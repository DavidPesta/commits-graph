## Demo

1. [Here](http://oct.tclh123.com/commits-graph/) is a pure HTML5+JS version, which hosted by github pages.
2. [Demo](https://github.com/tclh123/commits-graph/tree/master/demo) is a python version, which shows how I get preformatted data.

    To run it, you should install [libgit2](https://github.com/libgit2/pygit2) first, and then install all python dependencies through `pip install -r demo/requirements.txt`.
    Finally, you can `./tools/run_demo.sh`.

## FAQ

1. How do you get preformatted data to draw this graph?

    see `git/` & `demo/`.
